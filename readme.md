## Description

This application is used to check available flights and round trips between national airports, bringing the best and cheapeast routes, with their respective prices including taxes, distances, exact location of airports, etc. 

Airports can be ignored by means of deactivation through a web panel. 

## Installation step by step

- clone the repository and run the container

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renantorres07/passagenspromo.git
```

```bash
